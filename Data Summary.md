This is also evidence with the median and mode of 51.46 and 12.96 respectively. Another interesting about this dataset is that the mean profit of 20.34 which is lower as compared to its standard deviation. This is as a result of sales made having outliers causing a lower median and mode values of 8 and 0 respectively.
